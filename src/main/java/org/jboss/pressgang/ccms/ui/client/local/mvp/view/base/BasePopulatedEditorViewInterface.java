/**
 * The interface for views that display ui elements defined in an editor that
 * is populated from an external object.
 * <p/>
 * This interface just combines the BaseCustomViewInterface and BaseEditorViewInterface interfaces.
 * The BaseCustomViewInterface interface provides a method for supplying the object that will be used as
 * the data source for the editor. This object is either used by the editor directly, in which case T and W
 * will be the same type, or indirectly, in which case W will usually be constructed with a reference to T.
 *
 * @param <T> The entity that this view displays
 * @param <W> The source of the data used to populate the editor
 * @param <X> The editor that links ui elements to an instance of W
